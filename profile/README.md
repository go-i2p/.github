### Go I2P library users: module path changes!

The module path for the Go SAMv3 libraries is changing from the personal namespace(`eyedeekay`) to the `go-i2p` namespace.
This will affect you when you update your SAMv3 or I2PControl library versions.
To upgrade:

```sh
#1: first, delete the old module paths from your go.mod
grep -v 'eyedeekay' go.mod > go.mod.new && mv go.mod.new go.mod
#2: then regenerate your go.mod file
go mod tidy
```

The new module paths are listed below:
